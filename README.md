## xwp_petsc : X-ray wave propagation in PETSc
Code for evaluation of wave propagation (fourier and real space approaches) using PETSc. Works for 1D and 2D for free space and matter.

#### Currently implemented  :
- Full Array Fresnel Multislice : Iterate between slice projections diffraction and free space propagation
- Finite Difference method : Solve the Helmholtz PDE using TS integrator

Further information on generating the zone plate test object and running the simulations is provided in the [project wiki](https://github.com/s-sajid-ali/xwp_petsc/wiki).
